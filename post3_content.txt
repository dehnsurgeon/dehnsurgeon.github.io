A polygon with n sides was an example of an object with a finite collection of symmetries. This post will focus on another example:
the roots of a polynomial (the solutions to {italic: the polynomial} = 0).

A polynomial is an expression in some indeterminate (we will use x) found by adding together powers of x with coefficients in front. The degree
is the largest power of X that appears; the polynomial x^5 - x - 1 has degree 5 {arrow: quintic}. 

{box: A polynomial is "solvable by radicals" if we can write down a root of the polynomial using only radicals {nth root} and the basic operations of arithmetic.}

[worked solution (by completing the square) of x^2 + x + 1 being solved by radicals]

During the 19th century there was a revolution (not {that one} or {that one}) in algebra. It is fitting that this revolution was set in motion
by a political activist of the day: Évariste Galois (1811-1832). At the time that Galois' work was published, it was known that a
{underline: general} quintic could not be solved by radicals. But this doesn't tell us about the solvability of say x^5 - x - 1.

"Adjoignons à l’équation le radical en question; nous pourrons raisonner maintenant sur le nouveau groupe comme sur le précédent,
et il faudra qu’il se décompose lui-même de la manière indiquée, et ainsi de suite, jusqu’à un certain groupe qui ne contiendra plus
qu’une seule permutation." - Galois sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations par radicaux.

Here Galois is noting that to solve a polynomial by radicals is to add radicals {examples: {cube root}2 {square root}{(1+{cube root}5)/2} {square root}{-1}}
to our usual {italics: rational} numbers {examples of rationals: 3/2 241/753 -14/19} until the polynomial factors into linear terms over this larger collection
of numbers.

[example of such factorization: x^2 + x + 1]

You may think there is a problem with adding {square root}{-1} to the rational numbers; maybe unlike {square root}2 which exists as a real number (albeit an
irrational one) the square root of a negative number cannot exist. You are wrong.

Well, that was a little harsh. There is reason for some alarm: there are "laws" we have to carefully avoid when working with {square root}{-1}.
[-1 = {square root}{-1} x {square root}{-1} ={under: false!} {square root}{-1 x -1} = {square root}1 = 1]
The fix is to not work with {square root}{-1} but instead with an abstract symbol i satisfying i^2 = -1. In fact, this is how we prefer to treat all
radicals. When we adjoin a radical to the rationals it is an abstract symbol satisfying some polynomial equation.

Some roots of polynomials cannot be expressed by radicals, but this doesn't stop us working with these numbers in just the same way. Let the symbol {alpha} have the
property that {alpha}^5 - {alpha} - 1 = 0. Then usual rational arithmetic is extended to include the symbol {alpha}.

[calculation in this number field: simplify a fraction]

When a number, such as these, is the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients, we call it {italic: algebraic}. The collection of rational numbers adjoined by
an algebraic number is called an algebraic number field (or number field for short). The calculation above takes place in the field Q(alpha) - the rationals adjoined by
a symbol {alpha} with {alpha}^5 - {alpha} - 1 = 0.

What does this all have to do with symmetries?
Galois studied polynomials by their groups.

[permutations again!]

The study of groups is at the core of modern algebra.
